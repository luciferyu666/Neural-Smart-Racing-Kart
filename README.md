Neural-Smart-Racing-Kart
The way to experiment with self-driving AI.

Developed ML-Agents self-driving training project, learn through neural network technology, first use the game as a training simulator for self-driving system, strengthen the system to avoid collisions and achieve the purposeDriving behavior such as ground and maintenance in the middle of the road. Autonomous driving is a big application area for ML-Agents because it doesn't need to drive on real roads like Uber, and machine learning simulations can be used to avoid real road measurementsThe test brought the accident.

The scene range of future games includes winding city streets, mountains, deserts, and highways, each with dozens of different weather and many different cars. With a combination of different scenes, weather and modes of transport, the autonomous driving system can learn in a wide range of situations in a short time.
